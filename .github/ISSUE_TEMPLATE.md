Having issues when using a CC2531?
- Make sure the CC2531 is connected through a USB extension cable
- Try the source routing firmware: https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin/source_routing
- With larger networks (30/40+) devices, your CC2531 might not be powerful enough. This will cause weird issues, in this case it's advised to use a more powerful adapter: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html#texas-instruments-cc26x2r1
